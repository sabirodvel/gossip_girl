Hello Sunshine Elites, 

I have the biggest news **EVER**! 

This spring, the elites are throwing the most exclusive Bachelorette party for our beloved queen Malini. 

Do you want to crash the party? Well, you know I never disappoint. 

I have insider info about the secret puzzles and codes. Solve these, and you can find out the location and attend the most private party of this season. 

â€”*XOXO*, **Gossip Girl** ðŸ’‹
