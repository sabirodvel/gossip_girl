## Hint

Riddle me this:

I'm a pathway without a door,\
Made of steel or concrete floor.\
Connecting places far and wide,\
Over water or a mountainside.\
No locks or keys, just open space,\
People and cars set the pace.\
Not alive, but a structure strong,\
What am I, where you walk along?

So, dear readers, what am I? Can you crack this puzzle?
