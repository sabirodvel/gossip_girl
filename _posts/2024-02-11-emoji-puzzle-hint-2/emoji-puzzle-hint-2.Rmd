Hello Southern Beauties, 

Gossip Girl here! 

Looks like our 1st emoji has been revealed. And you know, what I like more than a solved puzzle? - It is an unsolved one. 

## Hint

Unlock the series of emojis to unveil a location.

[ðŸŒˆâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ]

Sounds like the Country Queens have been listening to a secret playlist. And my sources tell me, the song in this [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6kLaF6fHaKlfmZz7gGdXvJ?si=veetImBrRdSTQcQyqcUyzA&pi=u-ygmMlW2oT8i1&nd=1&dlsi=55f2361834544cff) holds the key to finding your next emoji.

So, listen in and unlock the 2nd mysterious emoji.

## Check Your Answer

Think you know the answer?

Insert the secret EMOJI down below:

```{r}
check_question(answer = "â›ª", right = "Correct!", wrong = "Awe... You missed. Try Again!")
```

----------------------------------------------------------
*PS: To unlock your next hint, send me a screenshot of the correct answer! Don't forget to mention the secret emoji!*

-*XOXO*, **Gossip Girl**
